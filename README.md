People who work with R also want access to sensitive data which are provided in the GESIS Secure Data Center (SDC). Yet, R often does not have the same feature set as other software packages, such as Stata. This `R`-package aims to imitate some of these functions:
  - Creating a log file from an R script
  - Extracting an R script from a log file
  - ...

The package can be installed with the R command:

```
devtools::install_github("stefmue/sdcR")
```
